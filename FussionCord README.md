## What is FussionCord?
FussionCord is a developer-focused communication and collaboration platform that blends the best parts of chat platforms and code hosting tools — chat channels, voice/rtc, repos, code snippets, code reviews, and a native-first AI assistant called **OpenDevin** *(planned)*. It's meant for teams, open-source projects, and solo devs who want a warm, integrated, super-productive place to build together.

Think: a place to discuss an issue, open a PR, run CI, and ask an AI to suggest a fix — without context switching. uwu ✧

---

## Vision & Mission
- **Unify developer workflows** into a single, pleasant experience: conversation, code, CI, and AI help — all speaking the same language.
- **Empower devs** with tools that reduce friction: native code previews, quick deploys, repo + chat synchronicity, and AI assistants that respect privacy and consent.
- **Open & extensible**: we prefer openness, plugins, and docs so other devs can build on top of FussionCord.
- **Learning-first**: encourage mentorship, code review culture, and community-driven learning.

【Soft goals uwu】: be cute but professional, ergonomic UI, tiny delightful micro-interactions, and *developer hygiene* baked in.

---

## Status — Important Restart Note (please read)
**We are restarting this project from scratch.** All the progress made until now will be abandoned. We're intentionally wiping the board to rebuild better, cleaner, and faster using **Dart (Flutter)** for the client(s) and **Golang** for the backend. This rework will be heavily AI-driven from the ground up.

Why restart? Because the new vision needs a clean architecture, better infra choices, and a privacy-first plan for AI integration. We are **committed** to rebuilding everything with full energy and focus. Ganbatte! (がんばって) uwu ✦

---

## Core Features (planned — detailed)
Below are the features we *intend* to build, with notes about scope and why they matter.

### ✦ Real-time chat & channels
- Persistent channels (public/private), DMs, threads, mentions, reactions.
- Message formatting: markdown, code blocks with syntax highlighting, inline diffs.
- Message edit/delete history with audit (configurable retention).

### ✦ Voice / RTC (future)
- Lightweight voice rooms and screen sharing (later rollouts — webRTC based).

### ✦ First-class code handling
- Paste code snippets with language detection.
- Smart diffs for conversational code review.
- Inline comments that link to issues/PRs.

### ✦ Git integration & repos
- Create & browse repos from the app.
- Lightweight repo hosting to start (git backend), with support for webhooks and CI triggers.
- Code browsing and PR flow integrated with chat.

### ✦ OpenDevin (our in-house AI assistant — future)
- Contextual code completions, refactor suggestions, test generation, and code explainers.
- Security-aware assistants (lint & vulnerability checks in suggestions).

### ✦ Bots & extensibility
- Bot API, webhook system, and extensible SDKs so the community can add automations.

### ✦ Multi-platform apps
- Flutter-first app for Android, then expand to iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Detailed Tech Stack (why & how)
We want to be explicit about choices, trade-offs, and recommended libraries. These are *current plans* and can evolve.

### Backend — Golang (why)
- **Why Go?** Fast startup, great concurrency model, compiled binaries that are easy to deploy, superb ecosystem for building scalable APIs and services.

**Suggested ecosystem & libraries:**
- **HTTP / API**: Gin / Echo / Fiber (choose one; Gin or Fiber are great for speed and community).  
- **RPC / internal comms**: gRPC (for microservices) or protobuf-based payloads for typed contracts.
- **Git integration**: `go-git` or `libgit2` bindings for implementing git operations server-side; alternatively run a self-hosted Gitea for full git server flows and integrate its API.
- **Database**: Start with **Firebase Firestore** for super-fast iteration (auth + DB + realtime), then migrate heavy relational data and git metadata to **Postgres** (GORM or sqlx) when needed.
- **Object storage**: MinIO (S3 compatible) for repo artifacts, uploads, and large assets.
- **Caching / Queues**: Redis for caching & simple pub/sub; NATS or RabbitMQ for eventing and background tasks.
- **CI / Runner integration**: Dockerized runners; GitHub Actions / self-hosted runners; eventually our own lightweight runner infra.

### Frontend — Dart / Flutter (why)
- **Why Flutter?** Single codebase for mobile, web, and desktop; beautiful UI; excellent performance for UI animations; strong ecosystem.

**Suggested libraries & patterns:**
- **State management**: Riverpod / Provider / Bloc (Riverpod recommended for modern modularity).
- **Dependency injection**: get_it / injectable.
- **Networking**: `dio` for advanced HTTP needs; `grpc-dart` for gRPC endpoints.
- **Local DB & caching**: Hive / sembast for small local caches; shared_preferences for config.
- **Code preview**: Use `highlight` / custom syntax highlighters for code blocks.

### AI & OpenDevin stack (high-level)
- **Model hosting**: initially explore smaller open-source models (Llama variants, MPT, etc.) or hosted inference (if funding allows) — but design everything to be model-agnostic.
- **Embeddings / vector search**: Weaviate / Milvus / Pinecone for semantic search and context retrieval.
- **Fine-tuning & adapters**: LoRA-style adapters for efficient fine-tuning on code corpora.
- **Serving**: Triton / TorchServe / FastAPI wrappers for inference endpoints.
- **Safety / filters**: prompt-safety layers, code-safety lint pipelines, and a review sandbox.

### Observability / Monitoring
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics.  
- Sentry for crash & error reporting.  
- OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.

### DevOps & infra
- Docker + Docker Compose for local dev.  
- Kubernetes (k8s) for production scaling (optional early).  
- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for CI/CD; Codemagic for Flutter builds.
- Terraform for infra as code (cloud + infra provisioning).

---

## Architecture Overview (short)
1. **Gateway / API** (Golang): a public HTTP/gRPC gateway that handles auth, routing, rate-limiting, and client-specific shaping.
2. **Microservices**: small Golang services — `auth-service`, `chat-service`, `git-service`, `ai-service`, `media-service`.
3. **Realtime layer**: websockets or Firebase realtime for low-latency chat sync.
4. **Datastores**: Firestore for realtime prototyping; Postgres for relational; MinIO for objects; Redis for caching.
5. **AI infra**: Vector DB + model servers + safe inference middleware.

This separation allows us to scale pieces independently, test services in isolation, and replace components as we learn.

---

## Workflow — Step-by-step roadmap (EXTREMELY DETAILED)
This is the **exact** workflow you asked for — each step includes sub-tasks, tech tips, and acceptance criteria.

### Step 1 — Golang API + Firebase (MVP baseline)
**Goal:** Build a solid backend foundation and fast prototyping lane.

**Main tasks:**
- Initialize a Go monorepo or modular microservice repo.  
- Create `auth-service` that integrates with **Firebase Auth** (email/password, OAuth providers).  
- Create `chat-service` using Firestore for messages (fast prototyping) with rules for access control.
- Implement API gateway (Gin/Fiber) that proxies requests, applies JWT checks, and logs telemetry.

**Tech tips:**
- Use Firestore security rules early to avoid leaking data.  
- Wrap Firebase calls with small Go abstractions for easier testing/mocking.

**Acceptance:** Basic user signup/login, create/join channels, send/receive messages in real-time.


### Step 2 — Flutter app (Android-first)
**Goal:** Build a lovable first app for Android with polished UX.

**Main tasks:**
- Set up Flutter project structure (feature-first: `auth`, `chat`, `repos`, `profile`).
- Implement login flow using FirebaseAuth or custom JWT flow.
- Implement channel list, message view, new message composer, and code-preview widget.
- Add local caching and offline read for messages (Hive/sembast).

**Tech tips:**
- Use Riverpod for state management to keep UI reactive and testable.  
- Build attractive, minimal UI components with accessibility in mind.

**Acceptance:** MVP Android app that authenticates, shows channels, and sends messages.


### Step 3 — Integrate git functionality (server-side + client-side)
**Goal:** Give FussionCord native repo capabilities so devs can host & review code in-app.

**Main tasks:**
- Decide approach:
  - **Option A:** Integrate a self-hosted Gitea instance and interface via its API (fast).  
  - **Option B:** Implement git operations via `go-git`/`libgit2` for custom flows (slower, more flexible).
- Implement repo model and metadata in Postgres (when ready).  
- Add endpoints for: create repo, push/pull hooks, open PR, view commit diffs.
- Build webhooks to trigger CI / AI analysis on PRs.

**Tech tips:**
- Start with Gitea for speed; switch to custom if we need unique features.
- Store git objects in object-storage (MinIO) if self-hosted.

**Acceptance:** Users can create a repo, push code (or import), open PRs, and see diffs inline.


### Step 4 — Make the Flutter app cross-platform (web, windows, macos, linux)
**Goal:** Turn the Android app into a true multi-platform client.

**Main tasks:**
- Audit platform-specific code (file pickers, notifications, native plugins).  
- Use platform-conditional implementations for native features.  
- Configure desktop builds and packaging (MSIX for Windows, dmg for macOS, AppImage/deb for Linux).  
- Setup web-build compatibility (css, web sockets, file upload handlers).

**Tech tips:**
- Keep UI responsive; avoid pixel-perfect mobile-only layouts for desktop.
- Use feature flags if certain platform features are not ready.

**Acceptance:** Build artifacts for Android + Web + at least one desktop platform (e.g. Windows).


### Step 5 — Extreme optimization
**Goal:** Make the app feel snappy on all platforms and reduce memory/CPU usage.

**Main tasks:**
- Profile Flutter UI with Observatory / DevTools and optimize rebuilds.  
- Use efficient image & asset compression; lazy-load large lists.  
- Optimize backend endpoints for pagination and conditional requests.  
- Add caching layers (Redis, client cache) and CDN for static assets.

**Tech tips:**
- Avoid large synchronous JSON parsing on the main thread.  
- Use code-splitting for web; use native compilation flags for desktop.

**Acceptance:** Performance benchmarks met for 90th percentile user flows (chat, code browsing).


### Step 6 — Integrate OpenDevin with git functionality
**Goal:** Offer an integrated AI assistant that understands repository context and suggests code-level help.

**Main tasks:**
- Build an `ai-service` that consumes commits, PR diffs, and code context from repositories.
- Create secure endpoints for analysis requests (with rate limiting and user tokens).
- Implement short-term context retrieval using embeddings + vector DB for fast, relevant results.
- Offer features: inline suggestions, PR summarization, test-case generation, and code explainers.

**Tech tips:**
- Only send code snippets with user consent (default: explicit opt-in for sample collection).  
- Implement a review sandbox where generated code can be linted and security-scanned before showing to users.

**Acceptance:** AI can produce meaningful suggestions in PRs and answer repo-specific queries.


### Step 7 — Data collection, consent & model improvements
**Goal:** Collect training & feedback data ethically, improve models iteratively.

**Main tasks:**
- Build a **consent framework** where users opt-in to let OpenDevin see their code for model improvement.
- Store labeled feedback safely: allow users to delete their training contributions.
- Use differential privacy / anonymization for shared training sets.
- Build an internal annotation tool for human reviewers & maintainers.

**Tech tips:**
- Keep privacy by default: opt-out unless explicitly chosen.
- Log model suggestions and downstream results for debugging, not for training unless consented.

**Acceptance:** Clear consent UX, ability to remove user data, and initial closed-loop training pipeline.


### Step 8 — Release strategy (open-source preferred)
**Goal:** Release an OSS MVP (depends on funding and demand).

**Main tasks:**
- Choose a license (MIT / Apache 2.0 recommended).  
- Publish server & client repos with clear CONTRIBUTING.md and developer docs.  
- Build a community space for discussion, issues, and PRs.  
- Seek funding: sponsors, grants, or optional enterprise features for revenue.

**Tech tips:**
- Keep core infra open-source; cloud hosting & model hosting can be paid/proprietary tiers later.

**Acceptance:** Public repos, community onboarding docs, and initial contributors.


### Step 9 — Docs & bot ecosystem
**Goal:** Make it trivial for others to add bots, plugins, and integrate apps.

**Main tasks:**
- Create `docs/` with API reference, SDK examples (Dart, Go, JS), and tutorials.  
- Publish a `bots/` guide with templates and sample bots (welcome-bot, ci-bot, pr-bot).  
- Add an official docs site (Docusaurus / MkDocs) with search.

**Acceptance:** Full developer docs for building a simple bot and registering it with FussionCord.


### Step 10 — Dedicated security sprint
**Goal:** Harden system, run audits, and fix vuln classes.

**Main tasks:**
- Threat-model the entire platform.  
- Run automated SAST & DAST tools.  
- Hire or coordinate a third-party pentest.  
- Add runtime protections: WAF, rate-limits, CAPTCHAs on sensitive endpoints.

**Acceptance:** Security report with prioritized remediation, fixes deployed, and re-test passed.


### Step 11 — Continuous improvement
**Goal:** Iterate on feedback, scale the org, and keep the platform growing.

**Main tasks:**
- Maintain a public roadmap.  
- Set up analytics dashboards and feedback loops.  
- Grow community contributions and curate plugins & integrations.

**Acceptance:** Active contributors, regular releases, and product-market fit signals.

## Getting Started (dev setup)
This is a gentle starter guide for contributors who want to help get the first pieces shipping.

### Prereqs
- Go >= 1.20 (or latest stable)
- Flutter >= latest stable (for Android builds)  
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Firebase account and CLI (for initial prototyping)  

### Minimal local steps (MVP dev loop)
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-org/fussioncord.git`  
2. Backend: `cd backend && go mod tidy && go run ./cmd/gateway` (or use `docker-compose up` for a convenience stack)  
3. Frontend: `cd client && flutter pub get && flutter run -d emulator-5554`  
4. Firebase: `firebase login && firebase init` (set up Firestore and Auth rules per docs)

> NOTE: This guide will become much more exact after the first release, but this should get you into the dev loop quickly.

## Contributing & How to Help (cute but serious!)
We want you, yes you! Whether you’re a frontend wizard, backend tamer, AI nerd, or documentation fairy — please come help.

**How to start:**
- Check `good-first-issue` for approachable tasks.  
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` once available and follow the code style.  
- Open tiny PRs often; we love small, focused changes.

**Areas we need help in right away:**
- Flutter UI polish & accessibility.  
- Golang API skeletons & auth flows.  
- Git integration experiments (go-git, Gitea prototypes).  
- Docs, guides, and onboarding flows.

**Community norms:**
- Be kind, helpful, and patient.  
- Use respectful language; focus on code, not people.  

---

## Documentation & Bots (long-term)
We will maintain a living `docs/` folder with examples, API references, and plugin guides. Bot docs will include:
- Bot registration & permissions model.  
- Example bots (PR reviewer, CI reporter, welcome bot).  
- SDK examples for Dart and Go.  

The final documentation will also include *extremely detailed* developer guides (how to implement custom auth, deep-dive on AI pipelines, infra runbooks, etc.).

---

## Security & Privacy (very detailed section)
Security and privacy are critical. We'll pursue a layered approach:

### Authentication & Authorization
- Adopt OAuth2 / OpenID Connect for federated auth and Firebase/Auth + our JWT gateway for internal flows.  
- Roles & Permission model for channels, repos, and bot scopes.

### Transport & Storage
- Enforce TLS everywhere (Let’s Encrypt / managed certificates).  
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (KMS / cloud provider keys or Vault).

### Secrets & Keys
- Central secret manager (HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS).  
- Short-lived credentials for internal services; rotate keys frequently.

### Code & Pull Request Safety
- Run static analysis (gosec, staticcheck, samy) and CI checks on PRs.  
- All code must be reviewed before merge.

### AI-safety & Data Handling
- **Consent-first**: user code never used for training unless explicitly opted-in.  
- Logging and telemetry will be separated from training pipelines.  
- Provide simple UI for users to remove their contributed training data.  
- Consider using differential privacy and carefully audited anonymization when constructing training corpora.

### Incident response
- Maintain incident response plan, playbooks, and communication templates.  
- Have a security channel and report process for vulnerabilities.

---

## Long-term Roadmap & Funding Thoughts
- **Phase 0 (MVP)**: Golang API + Firebase + Android Flutter client.  
- **Phase 1**: Git integration + Repo browsing + PR flows.  
- **Phase 2**: Cross-platform Flutter builds + performance optimization.  
- **Phase 3**: OpenDevin integration + consent-driven data pipelines.  
- **Phase 4**: Official open-source release + community growth.  
- **Phase 5**: Enterprise features, audits, and scaling infrastructure.

Funding possibilities: sponsors, GitHub Sponsors, donation drives, grants, or paid hosting/enterprise features. But keep core open-source for community growth if possible.

---

## Code of Conduct & License
Please follow our Code of Conduct (TBD) — be respectful and constructive.  
License: we'll start with **MIT** by default (simple, permissive). We can change to Apache 2.0 or other if we decide patent provisions matter.

---

## Final note — full energy restart!
I am going to **restart this project with full energy again**! All existing progress up to this point will be abandoned so we can rebuild a cleaner, safer, and more powerful FussionCord using **Dart (Flutter)** for the clients and **Golang** for the backend. This time it will be **AI-first** (OpenDevin-ready), privacy-conscious, and built to scale.

If you feel excited, nervous, or inspired — come join! Whether you want to design cute UI, harden auth flows, or train the AI, there is room here for every kind of dev-heart. UwU
